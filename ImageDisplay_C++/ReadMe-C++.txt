While running, please push the modify button to represent the Dct and Dwt results.

In the whole window, the left side image is presented by Dct and the right side is presented by Dwt. 

In my local machine, I take 18 sec to produce a Dwt result and 27 sec to produce a Dct result, thus;

when put -1 as the second parameter, it will take 45 sec to refresh the window in my local machine.

Also, I do the all row transform then all column transform in Dwt. And use the 3rd solution in Dwt  zig zag order. 

Thank you.
